Initial Planning

1. study existing systems
2. Frame usecase
3. Frame actors and communication entries to the system
4. Study about the technologies to be used.[May be not needed]
5. Coding [pure demoable code]
6. Presentable, so clear and promotional


Low prio
1. Production ready code
2. Effeciency

Demo Idea:
Don't implement the full system, but just few services... no map... 
just few seat numbers may be, few actors.... 

May be move the people from one seat to another seat...
